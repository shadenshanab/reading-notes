## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

### structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

## Give a real world example?

### key-value pair, documents, graph databases

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

### NoSQL database

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

### SQL databases

## What does SQL stand for?

### Structured Query Language

## What is a relational database?

### a database structured to recognize relations between stored items of information

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

### A relational database divides data into rows and columns, which form a table. Data is typically organized in multiple tables that can be linked together using a primary key or a foreign key

## What is a 'schema'?

### A database schema is the "blueprint" of a database that describes how data may be related to other tables or data models

## What is a NoSQL database?

### A NoSQL (not only sql) database is a mechanism for storing and retrieving data that is not modeled in the tabular relations used in relational databases

## How does it work?

### Documents, rather than relational tables, are used to store data in NoSQL databases. Accordingly, we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Pure document - oriented, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases are examples of NoSQL databases

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

### one or more collections of documents

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why

### MongoDB, because each individual record is stored as a document, which is a collection of fields with a dynamic schema Each collection does not have to have the same set of fields

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
