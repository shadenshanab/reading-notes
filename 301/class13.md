----------------

## What's the relationship between REST and CRUD?

### REST is an architectural framework that uses HTTP commands to focus on resources and hypermedia. In a database environment, the CRUD cycle is used to maintain records. In its most basic form, CRUD is a method of information manipulation that describes how an application works. REST uses HTTP instructions to control data.

## If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Set up a server.
2. Create routes (Read, Post, Update and Delete).
3. Compile data into a database.
4. Build a frontend.
5. Produce documentation.
