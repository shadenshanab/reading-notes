## Who is Roy Fielding?

### he is an american computer scientist and is one of the main authors of HTTP


## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

### Because they were not intended to be used in this manner. When Fielding and his colleagues began developing the web, being able to communicate with any machine anywhere in the world was a top priority. However, most of the techniques later developed to allow computers to communicate with one another did not meet those requirements. You only needed to communicate with a small group of machines

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

### URL Using verbs to replace nouns When you go to a web page, for example, the browser performs an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and returns a web page

## What does a GET do?

### When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human-readable "representation" of that data

## What does a POST do?

### add something to another system

## What does PUT do?

### replace something in another system

## What does PATCH do?
