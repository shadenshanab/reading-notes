## Test Driven developement

---------

### TDD suggests writing tests that check the functionality of your code before writing the actual code. Only after you are satisfied with your tests and the features they test, do you begin writing the actual code to satisfy the conditions imposed by the test that would allow them to pass

### Following this procedure ensures that the code you write is carefully planned in order to pass these tests. This also eliminates the possibility of writing tests being postponed to a later date because they may not be deemed necessary in comparison to other features that may be created during that time

### Tests also give you confidence when you start refactoring code because you are more likely to catch bugs because tests provide instant feedback

## if name equals main

---------

### Python files are known as modules, and they are distinguished by the.py file extension. Functions, classes, and variables can all be defined by a module

### When the interpreter executes a module, the name variable is set to main if the module being executed is the main program

### However, if the code imports the module from another module, the name variable will be set to the name of that module

## recursion

---------

### A recursive function solves a specific problem by calling itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problem. As and when needed, many more recursive calls can be generated. It is critical to understand that we must provide a specific case in order to end this recursion process. So we can say that the function calls itself with a simplified version of the original problem every time
