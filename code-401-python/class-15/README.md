## Binary Trees

--------------

### Tree is a non-linear data structure. It is a hierarchical data structure that has nodes connected through links. The topmost node of the tree which has no parent is known as the root node.

### Binary Tree is a form of a tree whose nodes cannot have more than two children. Each node of the binary tree has two pointers associated with it, one points to the left child, and the other points to the right child of the node. It is an unordered tree having no fixed organized structure for the arrangement of nodes.

#### Note: Binary Tree is slow for the searching, insertion, or deletion of the data because of its unordered structure. The time complexity of these operations is O(N).

### Binary Search Tree(BST) is a type of binary tree which is in ordered form. It has a fixed organized structure for the arrangement of nodes. The structure follows the following rules:

- Left child of the node must have a value less than its parent’s value
- Right child of the node must have a value greater than its parent’s value

#### Note: BST is faster than a binary tree in the searching, insertion, or deletion of the data because of its ordered structure. The time complexity of these operations is O(log N)
