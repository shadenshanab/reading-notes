## Big O Notation and linked lists

--------------

### Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes a function's limiting behavior when the argument tends towards a specific value or infinity

### Big O notation, in simple terms, describes the complexity of your code in algebraic terms

### The selection sort algorithm is an example of an algorithm with an O(n2) complexity. The selection sort algorithm iterates through the list to ensure that every element at index I is the list's ith smallest/largest element

### A Singly Linked List is a subset of a generic linked list. Each node in a singly linked list links to only the next node in the sequence, so if we start traversing the list from the first node, we can only move in one direction

### A linked list is a collection of objects called nodes that are stored in memory at random

### A node has two fields: data stored at that specific address and a pointer containing the address of the next node in memory

### The list's final node contains a pointer to the null

## Types And Values in Python

### A Python assignment statement, like many other programming languages, associates a symbolic name on the left with a value on the right. Names in Python are said to refer to values, or a name is a reference to a value

### There is no rule stating that a value may only have one name. A second (or third, or...) name can be assigned to the same value using an assignment statement

### If two names refer to the same value, this does not automatically connect them. Reassigning one does not imply reassigning the other

### If two names refer to the same value, this does not automatically link the two names. Reassigning one of them does not imply reassigning the other

### It's also worth noting that Python lacks a mechanism for making one name refer to another. That is, no matter how x is reassigned, there is no way to make y a permanent alias for x
