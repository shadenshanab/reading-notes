## Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS

--------------

## What is Next Js

Next.js is a framework for building server-rendered or statically-exported React applications. It is built on top of React, and it makes it easier to build universal React applications that are optimized for performance and can be easily deployed.

Next.js handles the process of server-side rendering, which means that it can render your React components on the server before sending them to the client. This can improve the performance of your application, especially for users with slow internet connections or on low-powered devices. It also allows you to create isomorphic or universal applications, which means that the same code can be run on the server and the client.

In addition to server-side rendering, Next.js also provides features such as automatic code splitting, which allows you to split your application into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This can help reduce the initial load time of your application and improve the overall performance.

Next.js is widely used in the React community and has a large and active developer community. It is maintained by the team at Vercel (formerly known as Zeit), and it is constantly being updated with new features and improvements.

## What is Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that provides a set of utility classes for building designs without the need for custom styles. It is designed to be customizable, but also provides a set of default styles that can be used to build simple layouts quickly.

The main idea behind Tailwind CSS is that you can style your HTML elements by applying pre-defined classes, rather than writing your own CSS styles. For example, instead of writing a custom style to set the font size of an element, you can apply a class like `text-lg` to set the font size to large. This can make it easier to build layouts and styles, as you don't have to worry about writing complex CSS styles or keeping track of custom class names.

Tailwind CSS is a popular choice for building modern, responsive web applications, and it is used by many developers and companies around the world. It is easy to learn and use, and it can be customized to fit the needs of your application.
