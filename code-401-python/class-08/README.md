## Pandas

--------------------

### Pandas is a popular open source Python package for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of Numpy, another package that supports multidimensional arrays. Pandas, as one of the most popular data wrangling packages, integrates well with many other data science modules within the Python ecosystem and is typically included in all Python distributions

### Pandas makes it simple to do many of the time consuming, repetitive tasks associated with working with data, including:-

- Data cleansing
- Data fill
- Data normalization
- Merges and joins
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Data inspection
- Loading and saving data
- And much more

### Pandas is a game changer in data science and analytics, especially if you came to Python looking for something more powerful than Excel and VBA. Pandas employs quick, flexible, and expressive data structures that make working with relational or labeled data simple and intuitive
