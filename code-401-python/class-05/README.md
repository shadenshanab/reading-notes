## Intro to OOP

----------------

### Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object is a data field with distinct attributes and behavior

### Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This programming approach is ideal for large, complex programs that are constantly updated or maintained. This includes manufacturing and design software, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used to create manufacturing system simulation software

### The structure of an object-oriented program also lends itself to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Other advantages of OOP include code reuse, scalability, and efficiency

----------------

- Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.

- Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity. When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.

- Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.

- Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself

### The main principles of OOP include:-

- Encapsulation

- Abstraction

- Inheritance

- Polymorphism
