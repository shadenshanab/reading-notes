## Big O Notation

-----------------

### In computer science, Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O expresses the worst-case scenario and can be used to describe the execution time or space required by an algorithm (e.g., in memory or on disk)

## O(1)

### O(1) denotes an algorithm that, regardless of the size of the input data set, will always execute in the same time (or space)

## O(n)

### O(N) denotes an algorithm whose performance grows linearly and proportionally to the size of the input data set. The following example also shows how Big O favors the worst-case performance scenario

## O(N2)

### O(N2) denotes an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the input data set size. This is typical of algorithms that use nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will yield O(N3), O(N4), and so on

## O(2^N)

### The notation O(2N) refers to an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. An O(2N) function's growth curve is exponential, beginning very shallow and rising meteorically
